    <p>  Scala (pronounced as Scaaah-lah) is multi purpose programming language targeting the JVM (That compiles to bytecode) and tries to combine both object oriented and functional paradigms of programming. Scala was created by Dr.Martin Odersky and the official website of scala is <a href="http://www-scala-lang.org" target="_blank">www.scala-lang.org</a>. As per the official website, scala is</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Object Oriented Meets Functional. Have the best of both the worlds. Construct elegant class hierarchies for maximum code reuse and extensibility, implement their behaviour using higher-order functions. Or anything in-between.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> Scala is a beautiful language that provides the programmer with lots of powerful abstractions to program. Since it compiles to bytecode, it can seamlessly interop with other Java and other JVM based languages.</p>
    <h4 id="statically-typed">Statically Typed</h4>
    <p>Scala is a statically typed programming language. Verbosity is usually one of the arguments against a statically typed programming language. But scala relieves a lot of that pain by inferring the types whenever possible. Also scala provides more syntactic advantages over other statically typed programming languages. Scala has a very complex type system that may seem daunting at first. But the reality is if you are a person using scala for general programming, you can write beautiful code even without knowing the type system completely. But as it is said, if you want to achieve greatness, you have to toil hard. If you want to reap the benefits of scala and fall in love with your code completely, you have to put in effort to master its type system.</p>
    <h4 id="scala-as-a-scripting-language">Scala as a scripting language</h4>
    <p>Scala can also be used as a scripting language. Just enter some scala code, save it in a file with the extension as <strong>&quot;.scala&quot;</strong>, execute the command <strong>&quot;scala filename.scala&quot;</strong>.</p>
    <h4 id="web-development-in-scala">Web development in scala</h4>
    <p>Scala has lots of powerful frameworks for creating web applications. <a href="https://www.playframework.com" target="_blank">Play</a> is the defacto web framework for Scala backed by TypeSafe. TypeSafe is the commercial entity formed for providing professional  support to Scala and its frameworks.</p>
