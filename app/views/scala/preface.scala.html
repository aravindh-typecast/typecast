    <h1>Preface</h1>
    <p>I am writing this book as I learn scala. I have tried many times to learn scala but failed at it. Not because of
        lack of involvement or because of its daunting type system, but because of too much involvement and lack of a
        resource than can satisfy my quest for knowledge. I am some one who is kind of a deviator while reading. When
        ever I stumble upon something that is new to me, I spend time in searching and reading about the new things and
        thus end up in losing my interest over that I intended to read initially. This is my attempt to maintain my
        concentration as writing a book slows down my pace and helps me concentrate on what I want to read. If you are
        reading this book, there is very good chance that I am in a position to write decent scala code and hopefully you
        are also able to do so when you complete this book. Since I am someone who looks to the innermost details, I will
        try my best to write about deep stuff whenever possible. I have also faced one particular problem while reading
        programming books. Whenever I read about something that I already know, I get bored and will start to skim the book.
        That results in me missing some of the important topics. I am going to consciously try and write this book targeting
        different kinds of readers. Hence there will be three sections for every topic. 1. Beginner, 2. Intermediate and
        3.Advanced. There will three buttons on each page that allows you to select the type of content you wish to read.
        You can choose</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Beginner: If you know some basic programming other programming languages where you know what is a class, method,
            object, exceptions etc.</li>
        <li>Intermediate: If you know basics of scala where you know how to define a method in scala, classes and companion
            objects and you know to pass higher order functions and if you can port a java code to scala code.</li>
        <li>Advanced: If you can already write good scala code using some of its special features but still do not know
            many more abstractions provided by it and you are eager to explore more.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Last but not the least, I am in no way a professional writer and hence I am not going to follow any of the
        conventions followed while writing a book. I am going to write the way I like it and hopefully you also like it.</p>
