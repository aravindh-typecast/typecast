# Introduction
Scala (scalable language) is a multi paradigm programming language that compiles to bytecode targeting the JVM. Scala combines both the object oriented and functional style of programming that results in a programming language that has all code reusability benefits of an object oriented language and all the powerful abstractions of a functional language.

##Scala as an Object Oriented Language
What makes a language object oriented? If it has the following characteristics:
1. Encapsulation / Information hiding
2. Inheritance,
3. Polymorphism / Dynamic binding,
4. All predefined types are objects,
5. All user defined types are objects,
6. All operations are performed by sending messages to objects.

Scala supports all these qualities and uses a pure object oriented programming model where every value is an object and every operation is a message send. Along with these qualities, scala also has some additional constructs that build upon these.
1. Modular mixin composition using traits,
2. Self type,
3. Type abstraction.

##Scala as a Functional Languahe
Functional programming languages have been in the academia so far and are slowly coming to mainstream programming.
