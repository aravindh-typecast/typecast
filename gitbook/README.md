# Preface
I am writing this book as I learn scala. I have tried many times to learn scala but failed at it. Not because of lack of involvement or because of its daunting type system, but because of too much involvement and lack of a resource than can satisfy my quest for knowledge. I am some one who is kind of a deviator while reading. When ever I stumble upon something that is new to me, I spend time in searching and reading about the new things and thus end up in losing my interest over that I intended to read initially. This is my attempt to maintain my concentration as writing a book slows down my pace and helps me concentrate on what I want to read. If you are reading this book means that I am in a position to write decent scala code and hopefully you are also able to do so when you complete this book. Since I am someone who looks to the innermost details, I will try my best to write about deep stuff whenever possible. I have also faced one particular problem while reading programming books. Whenever I read about something that I already know, I get bored. Hence this book will contain two sections for every topic. One for beginners which will have clear detailed explanation and two for advanced readers which will talk about deeper stuff. Last but not the least, I am in no way a professional writer and hence I am not going to follow any of the conventions followed while writing a book. I am going to write the way I like it and hopefully you also like it.
